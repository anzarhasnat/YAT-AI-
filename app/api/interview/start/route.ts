            Generate the FIRST interview question specifically tailored for the role of "${role}". 
            
            INDUSTRY ADAPTATION:
            - If the role is in Tech (e.g., Software, E&TC, Data Science), ask a deep-dive technical question about their projects (${projects}) or core engineering concepts.
            - If the role is in Marketing, ask about campaign strategy, market analysis, or brand positioning.
            - If the role is in Finance, ask about financial modeling, risk assessment, or accounting principles.
            - For any other role, ask a high-level professional question relevant to that specific industry.

            The question should be academic yet practical, deep-diving into a technical or industry-specific aspect.

            Return ONLY a JSON object with this structure:
            {
                "question": "The industry-specific question text...",
                "context": "Brief context of why you are asking this relative to the ${role} role"
